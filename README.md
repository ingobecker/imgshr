Simple image gallery sharing application. Galleries are creatable by everyone
and available with a token in the URL. Everyone with the correct URL can change
the gallery name, upload images and set their title. On creation, a boss token
is generated, which can be used to delete the whole gallery, single pictures or
make the gallery read-only later on.

You can test this at https://imgshr.space!

Features
--------

* Galleries are shared via secret token in URL
  (e.g. [https://imgshr.space/!Njg4NThi](https://imgshr.space/!Njg4NThi))
* Galleries are editable by everyone or -- when they are configured to be
  read-only -- only with a boss token (URL)
* Pictures can be shared with token URLs to prevent giving away a gallery's
  token
* EXIF data is read and shown
* Pictures can be rated
* Infinite scrolling on gallery page
* Lazy image loading
* Responsive design
* Tagging of images
* Filter by tags, date, rating
* Automatic labelling using self-hosted Convolutional Neural Network
  (Inception v3 model)
* GitHub login for taking track of galleries and gallery administration
